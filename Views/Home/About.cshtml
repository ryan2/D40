<h3>What is the Asset Management Tool?</h3>
<p>The Asset Management Tool is an appplication developed as an internal tracking mechanism for IT assets used in ASPE. The tool allows ASPE to track the lifetime of all IT equipment for a given user, as well as any software and tickets associated with the assets and user. The tool also allows us to compare the official asset list from ITIO and identify errors or wrongly onboarded or offboarded personnel, and to track historical costs and perdict future costs for these assets.</p>
